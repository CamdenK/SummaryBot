[] - integration with paragraphs
[] - automatic line generation choice based on weights???
  []-check the weights of the outputs (describe a healthy range?)
  [] - perhaps just a percentage of lines? -- could work but would be bad for very dense text
[] - check if object vs set is optimal? Could be {word: count}, then when checking the overlap simply multiply their values
[] - special character dealing?
[] - expanding stopwords
[] - make into one file
[] - log10 vs ln

ONGOING
